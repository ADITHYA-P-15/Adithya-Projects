# WeatherPredictionModel

A machine learning project that leverages a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict weather conditions. This model is trained on historical weather data and makes predictions on unseen test data to provide reliable weather forecasts.

## Project Description

Weather prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of atmospheric conditions. This project uses ensemble learning with Random Forests to capture non-linear relationships in the weather data, improving prediction accuracy.

The model is trained on historical weather datasets and applied to the test dataset `weather_test_150` to generate predictions, which are saved as `weather_test_150_with_predictions.csv`.

## Features

- Utilizes Random Forest Classifier for robust and accurate predictions.
- Processes raw weather test data and outputs a CSV file with predicted weather outcomes.
- Modular Python scripts allowing easy modification and extension.
- Used python libraries - pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Machine Learning libraries - scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, Train_Test_Split)
